# Grandma Ester normally bakes you cookies for your birthday - one for every year old you are. 
# When you turned 15, she made you 15 cookies! 
# This year, she, unfortunately, cannot see you on your birthday, so instead, she wants to send you virtual cookies!
# Create a program that prompts the user for how old they are turning, and then, using a loop, outputs a virtual cookie for every year old they are.
