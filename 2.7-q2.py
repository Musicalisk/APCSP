# Write a program to calculate the farthest in each direction that the turtle was located throughout its travels.
# Add four print statements to the lines of code above that output the following, where the number signs are replaced with the correct values from the correct list:
lat=[15.18,15.11,15.12,15.12,15.08,14.95,14.87,14.81,14.81,14.75,14.73,14.68,14.55]

print('Farthest north is',max(lat),'\nFarthest west is',min(lon),'\nFarthest south is',min(lat),'\nFarthest east is',max(lon))
